### Synopsis
Allows you to play Sudoku against one friend. You can visit our page to play sudoku agianst the clock without logging in. But if you want to challenge a friend...our app uses a secure login or Facebook login to play Sudoku in "game rooms." Once you and a friend are in a game room, the two friends can play the same puzzle timed. Once one person finishes, the players are given their score/winner. The score or stats consist of how many squares they've filled out correctly within the time limit, and then given the opportunity to continue playing or leave the room. The room is then deleted when there are no members in the room. 

### Motivation
Creating an interactive game?! sounds delightful.
