##Sudoku-With-Friends

###Synopsis
Allows you to play Sudoku against one friend. Our app uses a login for specific users to play Sudoku in created "game rooms." Once in a game room, two friends can play the same puzzle timed. Once the time is over, the players are given their score, how many squares they've filled out correctly within the time limit, and then given the opportunity to continue playing or leave the room. The room is them deleted. 

###Motivation
Creating an interactive game?! sounds delightful. 

###Installation
What technologies are we using?

##API Reference
any apis?
Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

##Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
